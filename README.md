**PUBLIKATER** automatically ingests, scores, and summarizes scientific papers based on your highly specific topics of interest. Stay on top of the latest research without drowning in generic feeds.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

There are two ways to run Publikater: the **1-Click Launcher** (recommended for most users) or via manual command line setup.

### The 1-Click Launcher Way

We use a modern installation approach to ensure your local AI tools are hardware-accelerated and properly isolated.

**For Mac/Linux:**
1. Download or `git clone` this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the folder and run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

**For Windows:**
1. Download or `git clone` this repository.
2. Double-click the `start.bat` file.

*What does this do?*
It automatically checks for and installs `uv` (a blazingly fast Python manager), creates an isolated virtual environment, installs PyTorch optimally for your system (CUDA/MPS), builds the React frontend, and launches the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8001`!

### Manual Installation
Make sure you have Node.js (v18+) and Python (3.11+) with `uv` installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jakob-steuer/eureka.git
   cd eureka
   ```

2. **Start the Backend:**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   # Tip: Add your S2_API_KEY to the .env file for faster fetching!
   
   cd backend
   uv sync
   uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend:** (In a new terminal window)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser!

## 🎯 Tutorial: Setting Up Your First Topic

Publikater uses advanced AI to semantically match papers to your topics. The better you describe your topic, the better your feed will be!

**Pro Tip for Topic Descriptions:** Don't use a generic list of outcomes (like "predicts 3D structures"). Focus heavily on the *methodology* and the core concepts you want to read about.

### Example LLM Prompt to Generate a Great Topic
If you're unsure how to describe your topic, ask an LLM of your choice:
> *"I want to create a feed for academic papers about [Your Topic]. Write a 2-3 sentence description focusing strictly on the methodology and core technologies involved, avoiding generic outcomes. Then provide a comma-separated list of 3-5 hyper-specific keywords."*

### Example Topic
- **Name:** Foundation Models in Life Sciences
- **Description:** Applications of large language models (LLMs), transformer architectures, foundation models, and self-supervised deep learning architectures applied to biological data.
- **Keywords:** Foundation Models, Protein Language Models, RNA Language Models, DNA Language Models

> **⚠️ Note:** When you create a new topic, Publikater will immediately start fetching and scoring papers from the last 30 days. This **first sync may take a few minutes** depending on your hardware and network speed.

## 🧭 Using the Interface

Publikater uses a simple, swipe-like tri-state system to help you reach Inbox Zero.

- ⭐ **Star:** Save this paper. It will be permanently kept in your "Starred" feed for future reference.
- ✅ **Read (Acknowledge):** You've seen this paper, but don't need to save it. It will be hidden from your main feed unless you toggle "Show Read".
- ❌ **Discard:** Not relevant. Hides the paper entirely so it never clutters your feed again.

### Features at a Glance
- **Follow Authors:** Click the `+` icon next to an author's name on any paper. Every future paper they publish will automatically receive a score boost (+15%) and be highlighted in your feed!
- **Export Citations:** Easily export your starred papers to share or use in manuscripts.

### Zotero Integration
Every topic in Publikater features a dedicated "🪄 Zotero RSS URL" button at the top of the dashboard.

**How it works:**
1. Click the button to copy your unique topic URL.
2. In Zotero, go to *New Feed -> From URI* and paste the link.
3. High-confidence, AI-summarized papers will pipe straight into your reference manager!

*(We plan to add direct Zotero API key integration in the future. Pros: Direct PDF injection and two-way syncing. Cons: Requires giving the app full write access to your Zotero library.)*
